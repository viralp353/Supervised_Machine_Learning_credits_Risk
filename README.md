# Supervised_Machine_Learning_credits_Risk


## Background:


Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as the number of good loans easily outnumber the number of risky loans. Therefore, Weâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. To use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.final task is to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.


## Objectives:


The goals of this challenge :

*  Implement machine learning models.


*  Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance.


*  Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.


*  Train a logistic regression classifier (from Scikit-learn) using the resampled data.


*  Calculate the balanced accuracy score using balanced_accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.


*  Generate a confusion_matrix.


* Print the classification report (classification_report_imbalanced from imblearn.metrics).
