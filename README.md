# Supervised_Machine_Learning_credits_Risk


## Background:


Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as the number of good loans easily outnumber the number of risky loans. Therefore, Weâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. To use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.final task is to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.


## Objectives:


The goals of this challenge :

*  Implement machine learning models.


*  Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance.


*  Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.


*  Train a logistic regression classifier (from Scikit-learn) using the resampled data.


*  Calculate the balanced accuracy score using balanced_accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.


*  Generate a confusion_matrix.


* Print the classification report (classification_report_imbalanced from imblearn.metrics).

## Challenge_Summary:

#### (1)Credit Risk Resampling Techniques:


In this section, I compared oversampling,Undersampling &Combine algorithms to determine which algorithm results in the best performance.I did oversample the data using the naive random oversampling algorithm and the SMOTE algorithm.and I used undersampling the data using Cluster Centroids algorithm and Combination  data using the SMOTEENN algorithm For each algorithm.


#####  Naive Random Oversampling:


For Analysis, I used oversample the data using the naive random oversampling algorithm.I got count of the target classes like (low_risk: 51352) & (high_risk: 260 ).Then I used the resampled data to train a logistic regression model.I got  0.66 balanced accuracy score. Based on confusion matrix,I got (TRUE POSITIVE:57),(FALSE NEGATIVE:30),(FALSE POSITIVE:5694),(TRUE NEGATIVE:11424).For imbalanced_classification_report, We see that on table.

##### SMOTE Oversampling:


For Analysis, I used oversample the data using the SMOTE Oversampling algorithm.I got count of the target classes like (low_risk: 51352) & (high_risk: 260 ).Then I used the resampled data to train a logistic regression model.I got  0.63 balanced accuracy score. Based on confusion matrix,I got (TRUE POSITIVE:54),(FALSE NEGATIVE:33),(FALSE POSITIVE:6163),(TRUE NEGATIVE:10955).For imbalanced_classification_report, We see that on table.

##### Undersampling:

For Analysis, I used undersample the data using the Cluster Centroids algorithm .I got count of the target classes like (low_risk: 260) & (high_risk: 260 ).Then I used the resampled data to train a logistic regression model.I got  0.52 balanced accuracy score. Based on confusion matrix,I got (TRUE POSITIVE:56),(FALSE NEGATIVE:31),(FALSE POSITIVE:10221),(TRUE NEGATIVE:6897).For imbalanced_classification_report, We see that on table.

##### Combination (Over and Under) Sampling:


For Analysis, I used resample the data using the SMOTEENN algorithm .I got count of the target classes like (low_risk: 68460) & (high_risk: 62011 ).Then I used the resampled data to train a logistic regression model.I got  0.63 balanced accuracy score. Based on confusion matrix,I got (TRUE POSITIVE:61),(FALSE NEGATIVE:26),(FALSE POSITIVE:7294),(TRUE NEGATIVE:9824).For imbalanced_classification_report, We see that on table.
